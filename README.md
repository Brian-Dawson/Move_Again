# Move_Again

Intent

Move_Again is a project designed to help senior citizens who are unable to drive themselves move again. This will be achieved by creating a senior friendly web based application that will connect them with volunteers who are willing to drive them to various events held by the communities that they are apart of. This will help them stay apart of things that they love and keep them connected to the world.

Description

The seniors will be able to input the events that they wish to go to and the times for pick up and drop off. These times will then be checked against the volunteers who are signed up and they will be matched. There will also be checks for special circumstances such as the requirement for a wheelchair or if they require help to walk from their house to the vehicle. The senior end will also include large font, big buttons, and other features that assist with use.
